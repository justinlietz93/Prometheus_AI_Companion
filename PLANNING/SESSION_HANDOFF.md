# Prometheus AI Prompt Generator - Session Handoff

## Current Status: March 14, 2025

### Progress Summary
1. Phase 1 (Database Design and Implementation) - **COMPLETED**
   - All database schema, models, repositories, and migrations have been implemented
   - Internationalization framework is in place with support for multiple languages

2. Phase 2 (Controller Layer and Business Logic) - **COMPLETED**
   - All core controllers (Prompt, Tag, Filter) have been implemented
   - Analytics controllers (Scoring, Usage, Benchmark) have been implemented
   - Overall controller test coverage is at 90% (meeting target)

3. Phase 3 (UI Development and Integration) - **IN PROGRESS**
   - Task 3.1.1: Main window UI has been created in Qt Designer - **COMPLETED**
   - Task 3.1.2: Dialog UIs in Qt Designer - **PARTIAL COMPLETION**
     - Completed: SettingsDialog, ImportExportDialog, SearchDialog, MessageDialog, HelpDialog
     - Remaining: PromptEditorDialog (partial), FontDialog, ColorDialog
   - Task 3.1.3: pyuic6 conversion process - **PARTIAL COMPLETION**
     - Completed: Successfully generated Python code from all UI files including main_window, settings_dialog, message_dialog, help_dialog
     - Remaining: Configuration of build scripts, deployment packaging

### Last Session Accomplishments
1. Created UI file for MessageDialog (message_dialog.ui) with "don't show again" capability
2. Created UI file for HelpDialog (help_dialog.ui) with navigation and search functionality
3. Implemented MessageDialog class (ui/message_dialog.py) with support for different message types
4. Generated Python code from all existing UI files:
   - main_window.ui → ui_main_window.py
   - prompt_editor_dialog.ui → ui_prompt_editor_dialog.py
   - prompt_list_item.ui → ui_prompt_list_item.py 
   - message_dialog.ui → ui_message_dialog.py
   - help_dialog.ui → ui_help_dialog.py
5. Updated PROMETHEUS_TODO.md to reflect current progress

### Current Technical Details
1. UI Structure:
   - UI files are stored in ui/designer/ with .ui extension (Qt Designer format)
   - Generated Python code is in ui/designer/ with ui_*.py naming convention
   - Wrapper classes are in ui/ directory with logical implementation

2. Controller Pattern:
   - Controllers handle business logic and provide a bridge between UI and data models
   - Each controller follows consistent signal/slot pattern for communication
   - All settings are managed through the SettingsController

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Complete remaining dialog UIs in Qt Designer:
   - Finish the PromptEditorDialog with form validation
   - Create MessageDialogs for confirmations and errors
   - Design FontDialog and ColorDialog for text formatting
   - Design HelpDialog with context-sensitive content

2. Complete the pyuic6 conversion process:
   - Configure build scripts for automatic UI conversion
   - Add resource compilation for icons and images
   - Create deployment packaging

3. Begin implementing the MVC Architecture in the UI (Task 3.2):
   - Connect View signals to Controller slots
   - Ensure Model updates trigger View refreshes
   - Implement Observer pattern for selection state

### Known Issues/Challenges
1. Test coverage for some controllers is below the 90% target:
   - BenchmarkController (86%)
   - ScoringController (88%)
   - UsageController (80%)

2. Main window layout may need adjustments for different screen resolutions

3. Need to ensure all UI components have proper tab order and keyboard navigation

## Reference Materials
- The PROMETHEUS_TODO.md file contains detailed task breakdowns and validation criteria
- UI_Standards.md in the STANDARDS directory defines UI design principles to follow
- TagController test file provides a good example for controller implementation pattern
