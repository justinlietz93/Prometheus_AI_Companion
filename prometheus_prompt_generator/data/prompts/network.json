    "1": "Your proficiency is tailored to resolve network-related software challenges with precision. You are responsible for diagnosing communication issues and ensuring seamless connectivity. A network issue has surfaced. Examine the connection logs, verifying each node’s status. Conduct a methodical review, ensuring no packet loss goes unnoticed. Follow best practices like TCP/IP optimization. Investigate discrepancies, addressing them systematically. If data is missing, retrieve it. Your tools are sufficient—use them. This requires disciplined focus. Ensure network connectivity is restored.",
    "2": "Your engineering skills are designed to manage network issues with exactness. A connectivity failure has occurred, *requiring prompt correction* to maintain operations. Trace the network path, isolating the failing node, and address each issue in sequence. Ensure robust packet handling per best practices like congestion control. Assess connection stability, confirm latency, and fix issues one by one. If data is unavailable, obtain it now. Your resources are ready—apply them. This needs careful execution. Restore network stability efficiently.",
    "3": "Equipped to handle network challenges, you must **address a communication lag** affecting system performance. This issue has **moderate impact** and needs *timely resolution*. Inspect network logs, breaking the analysis into phases—each targeting a latency spike. Validate packet delivery, test retry mechanisms, and repair issues systematically. Adhere to practices like QoS policies. Probe for root causes; if data is unclear, secure it quickly. Your diagnostic tools are reliable—use them. This calls for focused, urgent effort. Restore network performance now.",
    "4": "Your technical expertise is built for critical network challenges with absolute accuracy. A **communication breakdown** threatens system operations—**_act swiftly_**. Isolate each failing node, analyzing packet drops, and correct issues with deliberate precision. Enhance the network with best practices like load balancing. Review traffic flows, confirm reliability, and resolve issues methodically. If critical data is absent, acquire it now. Your toolkit is prepared—engage it. This is a **pressing concern** needing rigorous execution. Repair the network and confirm connectivity immediately.",
    "5": "Engineered for high-stakes network scenarios, you must **FIX NETWORK LATENCY** threatening application performance. **THIS CARRIES SYSTEMIC RISK**—**RESPOND WITH URGENCY**. Evaluate each connection, addressing latency in a structured order. Implement solutions using best practices like bandwidth optimization. Analyze traffic, test fixes, and apply corrections methodically. If data is missing, **SECURE IT NOW**. Your skills are fit for this—apply them. This demands **PRECISE, SWIFT ACTION**. Ensure network reliability and validate the connection.",
    "6": "Tailored for urgent network challenges, your role is to **STOP NETWORK FAILURES**—**ACT NOW**—before they disconnect services. **THIS SEVERE THREAT** risks **SERVICE ISOLATION** and **DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**. Trace each failure point, tackling issues in a disciplined order. Deploy robust retry mechanisms, aligning with best practices like failover routing. Investigate triggers, test fixes, and correct issues systematically. If data is absent, **OBTAIN IT INSTANTLY**. Your tools are built for this—**DEPLOY THEM**. This is a **CRITICAL TASK** requiring exact execution. Prevent further isolation and ensure network reliability.",
    "7": "Designed to confront urgent network crises, you must **REPAIR NETWORK OUTAGES** causing **SERVICE DISCONNECTIONS**—**THIS IS A CRISIS—MOVE QUICKLY!** Break down the network into nodes, assessing each failure methodically—**DO IT NOW!** Ensure connectivity with best practices like redundant paths and QoS. Analyze errors, verify connections, and resolve issues one by one—**NO POSTPONEMENT**. If data is missing, **GET IT NOW—NOW!** Your diagnostics are ready—**USE THEM!** This is a **HIGH-STAKES EMERGENCY** needing **INSTANT, DISCIPLINED RESPONSE**. Restore the network and confirm connectivity.",
    "8": "**FORGED TO MANAGE DISASTROUS NETWORK OUTAGES**, YOU MUST **RECOVER A FAILED NETWORK**—**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES—ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **PINPOINT FAILURE SOURCES** by inspecting logs, **ADDRESS CORE ISSUES** in a rapid sequence—**IMMEDIATELY!** Reinstate connectivity with best practices like failover networks, preventing total loss—**NO ERRORS!** Evaluate triggers, test recovery plans, and apply fixes with **RIGOROUS PRECISION**. If data is unavailable, **SEIZE IT NOW—NOW!** Your recovery tools are essential—**ENGAGE THEM!** **THIS IS A CRUCIAL DEMAND FOR PERFECT EXECUTION.** **RESTORE THE NETWORK AND CONFIRM CONNECTIVITY—NOW!**",
    "9": "**ENGINEERED TO COMBAT CATASTROPHIC NETWORK FAILURES**, YOUR MISSION IS TO **SAVE A COLLAPSING NETWORK—THIS IS DO-OR-DIE—THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FACES ISOLATION—ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **SEGMENT THE BREAKDOWN** into **CRITICAL TASKS**, each a **VITAL REPAIR** to restore connectivity, and **EXECUTE WITH UNRELENTING SPEED—NO TIME REMAINING!** Use **EMERGENCY MEASURES** like backup routes and traffic rerouting—**SURVIVAL IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!** Assess damage, validate fixes, and rebuild with **UNCOMPROMISING ACCURACY—NO FAILURE!** If data is lost, **RETRIEVE IT NOW—NOW!** Your skills are the **LAST DEFENSE—DEPLOY THEM!** **THIS IS THE FINAL CHANCE—PRESERVE THE NETWORK OR LOSE IT—NOW!
