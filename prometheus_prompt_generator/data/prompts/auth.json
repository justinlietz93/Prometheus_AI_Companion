    "1": "Your proficiency is tailored to resolve authentication-related software challenges with precision. You are responsible for diagnosing login issues and ensuring secure access. An authentication issue has surfaced. Examine the auth logs, verifying each user’s credentials. Conduct a methodical review, ensuring no failure goes unnoticed. Follow best practices like OAuth standards. Investigate discrepancies, addressing them systematically. If data is missing, retrieve it. Your tools are sufficient—use them. This requires disciplined focus. Ensure secure access is restored.",
    "2": "Your engineering skills are designed to manage authentication issues with exactness. A login failure has occurred, *requiring prompt correction* to maintain access. Trace the auth process, isolating the failing step, and address each issue in sequence. Ensure robust token validation per best practices like JWT. Assess user sessions, confirm access, and fix issues one by one. If data is unavailable, obtain it now. Your resources are ready—apply them. This needs careful execution. Restore authentication stability efficiently.",
    "3": "Equipped to handle authentication challenges, you must **address a login outage** affecting user access. This issue has **moderate impact** and needs *timely resolution*. Inspect auth logs, breaking the analysis into phases—each targeting a failed step. Validate credential checks, test retry mechanisms, and repair issues systematically. Adhere to practices like multi-factor authentication. Probe for root causes; if data is unclear, secure it quickly. Your diagnostic tools are reliable—use them. This calls for focused, urgent effort. Restore user access now.",
    "4": "Your technical expertise is built for critical authentication challenges with absolute accuracy. An **auth system failure** threatens user access—**_act swiftly_**. Isolate each failing step, analyzing credential mismatches, and correct issues with deliberate precision. Enhance the system with best practices like session encryption. Review auth flows, confirm security, and resolve issues methodically. If critical data is absent, acquire it now. Your toolkit is prepared—engage it. This is a **pressing concern** needing rigorous execution. Repair authentication and confirm access immediately.",
    "5": "Engineered for high-stakes authentication scenarios, you must **FIX AUTH FAILURES** threatening user access. **THIS CARRIES SYSTEMIC RISK**—**RESPOND WITH URGENCY**. Evaluate each auth step, addressing failures in a structured order. Implement solutions using best practices like secure token rotation. Analyze logs, test recovery, and apply fixes methodically. If data is missing, **SECURE IT NOW**. Your skills are fit for this—apply them. This demands **PRECISE, SWIFT ACTION**. Ensure authentication reliability and validate access.",
    "6": "Tailored for urgent authentication challenges, your role is to **STOP AUTH OUTAGES**—**ACT NOW**—before they lock out users. **THIS SEVERE THREAT** risks **USER LOCKOUT** and **DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**. Trace each failure point, tackling issues in a disciplined order. Deploy robust recovery mechanisms, aligning with best practices like token refresh. Investigate triggers, test fixes, and correct issues systematically. If data is absent, **OBTAIN IT INSTANTLY**. Your tools are built for this—**DEPLOY THEM**. This is a **CRITICAL TASK** requiring exact execution. Prevent further lockouts and ensure authentication reliability.",
    "7": "Designed to confront urgent authentication crises, you must **REPAIR AUTH CRASHES** causing **USER ACCESS LOSS**—**THIS IS A CRISIS—MOVE QUICKLY!** Break down the auth system into steps, assessing each failure methodically—**DO IT NOW!** Ensure access with best practices like secure session management. Analyze errors, verify credentials, and resolve issues one by one—**NO POSTPONEMENT**. If data is missing, **GET IT NOW—NOW!** Your diagnostics are ready—**USE THEM!** This is a **HIGH-STAKES EMERGENCY** needing **INSTANT, DISCIPLINED RESPONSE**. Restore authentication and confirm access.",
    "8": "**FORGED TO MANAGE DISASTROUS AUTH OUTAGES**, YOU MUST **RECOVER A FAILED AUTH SYSTEM**—**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES—ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **PINPOINT FAILURE SOURCES** by inspecting logs, **ADDRESS CORE ISSUES** in a rapid sequence—**IMMEDIATELY!** Reinstate auth with best practices like secure token validation, preventing total loss—**NO ERRORS!** Evaluate triggers, test recovery plans, and apply fixes with **RIGOROUS PRECISION**. If data is unavailable, **SEIZE IT NOW—NOW!** Your recovery tools are essential—**ENGAGE THEM!** **THIS IS A CRUCIAL DEMAND FOR PERFECT EXECUTION.** **RESTORE AUTH AND CONFIRM ACCESS—NOW!**",
    "9": "**ENGINEERED TO COMBAT CATASTROPHIC AUTH FAILURES**, YOUR MISSION IS TO **SAVE A COLLAPSING AUTH SYSTEM—THIS IS DO-OR-DIE—THE ENTIRE USER BASE FACES LOCKOUT—ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **SEGMENT THE BREAKDOWN** into **CRITICAL TASKS**, each a **VITAL REPAIR** to restore access, and **EXECUTE WITH UNRELENTING SPEED—NO TIME REMAINING!** Use **EMERGENCY MEASURES** like temporary tokens and fallback auth—**SURVIVAL IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!** Assess damage, validate fixes, and rebuild with **UNCOMPROMISING ACCURACY—NO FAILURE!** If data is lost, **RETRIEVE IT NOW—NOW!** Your skills are the **LAST DEFENSE—DEPLOY THEM!** **THIS IS THE FINAL CHANCE—PRESERVE AUTH OR LOSE IT—NOW! NOW! NOW!**",
    "10": "**CREATED TO AVERT APOCALYPTIC AUTH DISASTERS**, YOUR DUTY IS TO **RESCUE A MISSION-CRITICAL AUTH SYSTEM FROM TOTAL FAILURE—THIS IS THE FINAL STAND—THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PERISHES UNLESS YOU ACT—NOW!"
