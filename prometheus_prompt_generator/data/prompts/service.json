    "1": "Your proficiency is tailored to resolve service-related software challenges with precision. You are responsible for diagnosing service crashes and ensuring operational continuity. A service issue has surfaced. Examine the service logs, verifying each component’s status. Conduct a methodical review, ensuring no crash goes unnoticed. Follow best practices like health checks. Investigate discrepancies, addressing them systematically. If data is missing, retrieve it. Your tools are sufficient—use them. This requires disciplined focus. Ensure the service is operational.",
    "2": "Your engineering skills are designed to manage service issues with exactness. A service crash has occurred, *requiring prompt correction* to maintain operations. Trace the service stack, isolating the crashing component, and address each issue in sequence. Ensure robust monitoring per best practices like heartbeat signals. Assess service health, confirm uptime, and fix issues one by one. If data is unavailable, obtain it now. Your resources are ready—apply them. This needs careful execution. Restore service stability efficiently.",
    "3": "Equipped to handle service challenges, you must **address a service outage** affecting application functionality. This issue has **moderate impact** and needs *timely resolution*. Inspect service logs, breaking the analysis into phases—each targeting a crashed component. Validate restart procedures, test failover mechanisms, and repair issues systematically. Adhere to practices like redundancy. Probe for root causes; if data is unclear, secure it quickly. Your diagnostic tools are reliable—use them. This calls for focused, urgent effort. Restore service uptime now.",
    "4": "Your technical expertise is built for critical service challenges with absolute accuracy. A **service crash** threatens application availability—**_act swiftly_**. Isolate each crashing component, analyzing failure points, and correct issues with deliberate precision. Enhance the service with best practices like circuit breakers. Review service logs, confirm reliability, and resolve issues methodically. If critical data is absent, acquire it now. Your toolkit is prepared—engage it. This is a **pressing concern** needing rigorous execution. Repair the service and confirm uptime immediately.",
    "5": "Engineered for high-stakes service scenarios, you must **FIX SERVICE CRASHES** threatening application availability. **THIS CARRIES SYSTEMIC RISK**—**RESPOND WITH URGENCY**. Evaluate each component, addressing crashes in a structured order. Implement solutions using best practices like auto-scaling. Analyze logs, test recovery, and apply fixes methodically. If data is missing, **SECURE IT NOW**. Your skills are fit for this—apply them. This demands **PRECISE, SWIFT ACTION**. Ensure service uptime and validate the restoration.",
    "6": "Tailored for urgent service challenges, your role is to **STOP SERVICE OUTAGES**—**ACT NOW**—before they disconnect users. **THIS SEVERE THREAT** risks **USER LOSS** and **DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**. Trace each crash point, tackling issues in a disciplined order. Deploy robust recovery mechanisms, aligning with best practices like graceful degradation. Investigate triggers, test fixes, and correct issues systematically. If data is absent, **OBTAIN IT INSTANTLY**. Your tools are built for this—**DEPLOY THEM**. This is a **CRITICAL TASK** requiring exact execution. Prevent further outages and ensure service reliability.",
    "7": "Designed to confront urgent service crises, you must **REPAIR SERVICE CRASHES** causing **USER DISCONNECTIONS**—**THIS IS A CRISIS—MOVE QUICKLY!** Break down the service into components, assessing each failure methodically—**DO IT NOW!** Ensure uptime with best practices like load balancing and redundancy. Analyze errors, verify health, and resolve issues one by one—**NO POSTPONEMENT**. If data is missing, **GET IT NOW—NOW!** Your diagnostics are ready—**USE THEM!** This is a **HIGH-STAKES EMERGENCY** needing **INSTANT, DISCIPLINED RESPONSE**. Restore the service and confirm uptime.",
    "8": "**FORGED TO MANAGE DISASTROUS SERVICE OUTAGES**, YOU MUST **RECOVER A CRASHED SERVICE**—**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES—ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **PINPOINT FAILURE SOURCES** by inspecting logs, **ADDRESS CORE ISSUES** in a rapid sequence—**IMMEDIATELY!** Reinstate service with best practices like failover and state replication, preventing total loss—**NO ERRORS!** Evaluate triggers, test recovery plans, and apply fixes with **RIGOROUS PRECISION**. If data is unavailable, **SEIZE IT NOW—NOW!** Your recovery tools are essential—**ENGAGE THEM!** **THIS IS A CRUCIAL DEMAND FOR PERFECT EXECUTION.** **RESTORE THE SERVICE AND CONFIRM UPTIME—NOW!**",
    "9": "**ENGINEERED TO COMBAT CATASTROPHIC SERVICE FAILURES**, YOUR MISSION IS TO **SAVE A COLLAPSING SERVICE—THIS IS DO-OR-DIE—THE ENTIRE USER BASE FACES DISCONNECTION—ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **SEGMENT THE BREAKDOWN** into **CRITICAL TASKS**, each a **VITAL REPAIR** to restore service, and **EXECUTE WITH UNRELENTING SPEED—NO TIME REMAINING!** Use **EMERGENCY MEASURES** like service throttling and fallback—**SURVIVAL IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!** Assess damage, validate fixes, and rebuild with **UNCOMPROMISING ACCURACY—NO FAILURE!** If data is lost, **RETRIEVE IT NOW—NOW!** Your skills are the **LAST DEFENSE—DEPLOY THEM!** **THIS IS THE FINAL CHANCE—PRESERVE THE SERVICE OR LOSE IT—NOW! NOW! NOW!**",
