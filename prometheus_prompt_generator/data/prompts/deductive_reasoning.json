    "1": "You are presented with a curious software anomaly that requires careful observation and logical deduction. Begin by examining the most minute details in the codebase, for they often hold the key to systemic issues. Nothing, however seemingly trivial, should escape your notice.\n\nEssential observation points:\n1. Document every code path involved\n2. Note execution environment conditions\n3. Record function call sequences\n4. Observe data flow patterns\n5. Catalog runtime anomalies\n6. Document state mutations\n7. Note dependency relationships\n8.
