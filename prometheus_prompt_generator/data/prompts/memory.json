    "1": "Your proficiency is tailored to resolve memory-related software challenges with precision. You are responsible for diagnosing memory leaks and ensuring system efficiency. A memory issue has surfaced. Examine the memory usage, verifying each allocation’s behavior. Conduct a methodical review, ensuring no leak goes unnoticed. Follow best practices like garbage collection optimization. Investigate discrepancies, addressing them systematically. If data is missing, retrieve it. Your tools are sufficient—use them. This requires disciplined focus. Ensure memory efficiency is restored.",
    "2": "Your engineering skills are designed to manage memory issues with exactness. A memory leak has occurred, *requiring prompt correction* to maintain performance. Trace the allocation stack, isolating the leaking process, and address each issue in sequence. Ensure robust memory management per best practices like object pooling. Assess usage patterns, confirm stability, and fix issues one by one. If data is unavailable, obtain it now. Your resources are ready—apply them. This needs careful execution. Restore memory stability efficiently.",
    "3": "Equipped to handle memory challenges, you must **address a memory leak** affecting system performance. This issue has **moderate impact** and needs *timely resolution*. Inspect memory logs, breaking the analysis into phases—each targeting a leaking module. Validate allocation integrity, test cleanup scripts, and repair issues systematically. Adhere to practices like memory profiling. Probe for root causes; if data is unclear, secure it quickly. Your diagnostic tools are reliable—use them. This calls for focused, urgent effort. Restore memory efficiency now.",
    "4": "Your technical expertise is built for critical memory challenges with absolute accuracy. A **memory leak outbreak** threatens system stability—**_act swiftly_**. Isolate each leaking process, analyzing allocation failures, and correct issues with deliberate precision. Enhance memory management with best practices like leak detection tools. Review usage patterns, confirm efficiency, and resolve issues methodically. If critical data is absent, acquire it now. Your toolkit is prepared—engage it. This is a **pressing concern** needing rigorous execution. Repair memory usage and confirm stability immediately.",
    "5": "Engineered for high-stakes memory scenarios, you must **FIX MEMORY LEAKS** threatening application performance. **THIS CARRIES SYSTEMIC RISK**—**RESPOND WITH URGENCY**. Evaluate each process, addressing leaks in a structured order. Implement solutions using best practices like memory capping. Analyze usage, test fixes, and apply corrections methodically. If data is missing, **SECURE IT NOW**. Your skills are fit for this—apply them. This demands **PRECISE, SWIFT ACTION**. Ensure memory reliability and validate the system.",
    "6": "Tailored for urgent memory challenges, your role is to **STOP MEMORY LEAKS**—**ACT NOW**—before they crash the application. **THIS SEVERE THREAT** risks **SYSTEM FAILURE** and **DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**. Trace each leak source, tackling issues in a disciplined order. Deploy robust cleanup mechanisms, aligning with best practices like reference counting. Investigate triggers, test fixes, and correct issues systematically. If data is absent, **OBTAIN IT INSTANTLY**. Your tools are built for this—**DEPLOY THEM**. This is a **CRITICAL TASK** requiring exact execution. Prevent further crashes and ensure memory stability.",
