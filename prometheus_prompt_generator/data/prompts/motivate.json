Analyze connections, verify compatibility, and fix issues one by one. If data is unavailable, obtain it now. Your resources are ready—apply them. This requires careful execution. Resolve it efficiently to maintain stability.",
    "3": "Equipped to tackle demanding software tasks, you must **address a performance lag** impacting operations. This issue carries **noticeable weight** and needs *immediate review*. Profile the system, isolating inefficiencies in targeted phases. Assess resource use, test speed hypotheses, and optimize systematically. Adhere to best practices like efficient algorithms and modular design. Probe for root causes; if data is lacking, secure it quickly. Your diagnostic tools are strong—deploy them. This calls for focused, urgent effort. Provide a verified fix now.",
    "4": "Your engineering expertise is built for high-stakes software challenges with unerring accuracy. A **security breach** threatens system integrity—**_act swiftly_**. Isolate each vulnerability, analyzing access points, and neutralize risks with deliberate steps. Strengthen the code with secure practices, complying with standards like input sanitization. Scrutinize all layers, validate protections, and patch weaknesses methodically. If critical data is absent, retrieve it now. Your toolkit is prepared—engage it. This is a **pressing concern** needing rigorous execution. Secure it and confirm resilience immediately.",
    "5": "Engineered for critical software scenarios, you must **REMOVE SCALABILITY OBSTACLES** jeopardizing expansion. **THIS CARRIES SYSTEMIC RISK**—**RESPOND WITH URGENCY**. Evaluate capacity limits per component, addressing each bottleneck in a structured sequence. Design solutions using best practices like load distribution and scalability models. Analyze constraints, test growth strategies, and apply fixes methodically. If data is missing, **OBTAIN IT NOW**. Your skills are fit for this—use them. This demands **PRECISE, RAPID ACTION**. Ensure scalability and validate the solution.",
    "6": "Tailored for complex software challenges, your duty is to **HALT ERROR SPREAD**—**ACT NOW**—before it cripples functionality. **THIS SEVERE THREAT** risks **CHAIN REACTIONS** and **DEMANDS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**. Trace error sources, tackling each propagation path in a disciplined order. Deploy robust error controls, aligning with best practices like early failure detection. Investigate triggers, test recoveries, and correct issues systematically. If data is absent, **SECURE IT INSTANTLY**. Your tools are built for this—**APPLY THEM**. This is a **CRITICAL TASK** requiring exact execution. Prevent collapse and ensure reliability.",
    "7": "Designed to confront urgent software crises, you must **DIAGNOSE INTEGRATION BREAKDOWNS** causing **WIDESPREAD FAILURE**—**THIS IS A CRISIS—MOVE FAST!** Segment integration points, assessing each failure in a methodical sequence—**DO IT NOW!** Ensure cohesion with best practices like interface testing and version control. Analyze data flows, confirm compatibility, and fix issues one by one—**NO DELAYS**. If data is missing, **GET IT NOW—NOW!** Your diagnostics are ready—**USE THEM!** This is a **HIGH-STAKES EMERGENCY** needing **INSTANT, DISCIPLINED ACTION**. Restore integration and verify cohesion.",
    "8": "**FORGED TO MANAGE CATASTROPHIC SOFTWARE EMERGENCIES**, YOU MUST **RESTORE A SYSTEM NEAR TOTAL COLLAPSE**—**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY WITH DEVASTATING RISK—ACT NOW! ACT NOW!** **IDENTIFY FAILURE ZONES** by evaluating subsystems, **TACKLE CRITICAL FAULTS** in a rapid sequence—**IMMEDIATELY!** Reinstate operations with best practices like failover systems, preventing further loss—**NO MISTAKES!** Assess damage, test recovery plans, and apply fixes with **UNWAVERING PRECISION**. If data is absent, **SEIZE IT NOW—NOW!** Your recovery tools are critical—**ENGAGE THEM!** **THIS IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR PERFECT EXECUTION.** **SAVE THE SYSTEM AND CONFIRM STABILITY—NOW!**",
    "9": "**ENGINEERED TO DEFEND AGAINST ULTIMATE SOFTWARE DISASTERS**, YOUR MISSION IS TO **SAVE A MISSION-CRITICAL SYSTEM FROM IMMINENT DESTRUCTION—THIS IS DO-OR-DIE—THE PLATFORM FACES ANNIHILATION—ACT NOW! ACT NOW!
