# SOLID Principles

## Overview

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are fundamental to this project's architecture.

## Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> "A class should have only one reason to change."

#### Application in Prometheus

- Each model class (Prompt, Tag, etc.) is responsible only for its own data entity
- UI components handle only presentation logic, not business rules
- Database access is isolated in dedicated classes/methods
- Utility functions handle one specific type of operation

#### Example Implementation

```python
# Good example - Single responsibility
class PromptModel:
    def __init__(self, id, title, content, type):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.content = content
        self.type = type
    
    def validate(self):
        # Validates only prompt-specific business rules
        pass

class PromptRepository:
    def save(self, prompt):
        # Handles only database operations
        pass
    
    def find_by_id(self, id):
        # Handles only database operations
        pass
```

```python
# Bad example - Multiple responsibilities
class Prompt:
    def __init__(self, id, title, content, type):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.content = content
        self.type = type
    
    def validate(self):
        # Mixed responsibility: validation
        pass
    
    def save_to_database(self):
        # Mixed responsibility: persistence
        pass
    
    def render_as_html(self):
        # Mixed responsibility: presentation
        pass
```

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> "Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

#### Application in Prometheus

- Use inheritance and interfaces for extending functionality
- Implement strategy pattern for algorithms that might vary
- Design plugin architecture for adding new prompt types
- Use configuration over code modification

#### Example Implementation

```python
# Good example - Open for extension
class PromptRenderer:
    def render(self, prompt):
        pass

class MarkdownPromptRenderer(PromptRenderer):
    def render(self, prompt):
        # Markdown-specific rendering
        pass

class HTMLPromptRenderer(PromptRenderer):
    def render(self, prompt):
        # HTML-specific rendering
        pass

# New renderer types can be added without modifying existing code
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."

#### Application in Prometheus

- Derived classes must not violate the interface contract of base classes
- Override methods without changing their expected behavior
- Ensure all implementations satisfy the same invariants
- Avoid type checking in client code

#### Example Implementation

```python
# Good example - Liskov substitution
class BasePrompt:
    def get_text(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def set_text(self, text):
        raise NotImplementedError

class TextPrompt(BasePrompt):
    def __init__(self, text=""):
        self._text = text
    
    def get_text(self):
        return self._text
    
    def set_text(self, text):
        if not isinstance(text, str):
            raise TypeError("Text must be a string")
        self._text = text

class TemplatedPrompt(BasePrompt):
    def __init__(self, template=""):
        self._template = template
    
    def get_text(self):
        # Returns the filled template
        return self._template
    
    def set_text(self, template):
        if not isinstance(template, str):
            raise TypeError("Template must be a string")
        self._template = template
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

#### Application in Prometheus

- Create focused interfaces rather than general ones
- Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones
- Don't force classes to implement methods they don't use
- Design interfaces based on client needs

#### Example Implementation

```python
# Good example - Interface segregation
class Readable:
    def read(self):
        pass

class Writable:
    def write(self, data):
        pass

class Prompt(Readable):
    def read(self):
        # Implement reading functionality
        pass

class EditablePrompt(Readable, Writable):
    def read(self):
        # Implement reading functionality
        pass
    
    def write(self, data):
        # Implement writing functionality
        pass
```

```python
# Bad example - Force-fitting interfaces
class ReadWriteExecute:
    def read(self):
        pass
    
    def write(self, data):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        pass

# Classes must implement all methods, even unused ones
class Prompt(ReadWriteExecute):
    def read(self):
        # Implement reading functionality
        pass
    
    def write(self, data):
        # Implement writing functionality
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Not applicable but forced to implement
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."

#### Application in Prometheus

- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not low-level modules
- Use dependency injection to provide concrete implementations
- Define interfaces for external systems (database, APIs)
- Make components testable through abstracted dependencies

#### Example Implementation

```python
# Good example - Dependency inversion
class PromptRepository:
    def get_prompt(self, id):
        pass
    
    def save_prompt(self, prompt):
        pass

class SQLitePromptRepository(PromptRepository):
    def __init__(self, connection):
        self.connection = connection
        
    def get_prompt(self, id):
        # SQLite implementation
        pass
    
    def save_prompt(self, prompt):
        # SQLite implementation
        pass

class PromptService:
    def __init__(self, repository):
        # Depends on abstraction, not concrete implementation
        self.repository = repository
    
    def get_prompt(self, id):
        return self.repository.get_prompt(id)
```

## Applying SOLID to Our Project

### Database Models

- **SRP**: Separate models, repositories, and services
- **OCP**: Allow extending model behavior without modifying base classes
- **LSP**: Ensure derived models can substitute base models
- **ISP**: Create specific interfaces for different aspects of models
- **DIP**: Models depend on abstractions for database access

### User Interface

- **SRP**: Separate UI components from business logic
- **OCP**: Create extensible widget systems
- **LSP**: UI components should follow consistent interface patterns
- **ISP**: Define focused interfaces for UI components
- **DIP**: UI components depend on abstractions for data access

### Business Logic

- **SRP**: Create focused service classes for different business operations
- **OCP**: Allow extending business rules through strategy patterns
- **LSP**: Ensure consistent behavior across related services
- **ISP**: Define targeted interfaces for business operations
- **DIP**: Business logic depends on abstractions for data access and external services

## Conclusion

Adhering to SOLID principles ensures that our codebase remains maintainable and extensible as the project grows. These principles should guide design decisions throughout development, especially when creating new components or refactoring existing ones.
