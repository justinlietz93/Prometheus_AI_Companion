# Prometheus AI Prompt Generator - Development Standards

## Introduction

This documentation establishes the development standards and best practices for the Prometheus AI Prompt Generator project. By following these guidelines, we ensure:

- **Consistency**: Code and designs remain consistent across the project
- **Maintainability**: Future developers can easily understand and modify code
- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Scalability**: The system can grow without requiring significant refactoring
- **Documentation**: Knowledge is preserved and accessible to all team members

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **New Team Members**: Start with this README, then review each standards document
2. **During Development**: Reference the relevant standards before implementing new features
3. **Code Reviews**: Verify that changes adhere to these established standards
4. **Extending Standards**: Submit proposed changes via pull request with justification

## Keeping Standards Up-to-Date

Standards should evolve as the project matures. When modifying standards:

1. Discuss significant changes with the team
2. Document the rationale for changes
3. Consider backward compatibility
4. Update affected code to maintain consistency

## Core Principles

Regardless of the specific standard, all development should adhere to these core principles:

- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **Clarity**: Write code and documentation that is easy to understand
- **Testability**: Design components to be easily testable
- **Security**: Consider security implications in all aspects of development
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance where it matters most
