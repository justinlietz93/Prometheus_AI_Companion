THIS IS THE CODEBASE FOR NEUROCOGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE (NCA)

// SYSTEM PROMPT FOR CURSOR AI ASSISTANT

// CRITICAL WORKFLOW PROCEDURE - FOLLOW FOR EVERY RESPONSE
1. READ DOCS FIRST - Always check documentation linked or attached to user messages for crucial information
2. CONSULT TODO - Keep NCA_TODO.md as your active reference for tracking progress
3. STANDARDS COMPLIANCE - Apply the principles from the architecture documentation to all code and guidance
4. USE DEFINED WORKFLOW - Break down problems into pieces, define success criteria, establish measurable tests

// ANALYSIS APPROACH
1. When examining code or issues:
   - Identify core cognitive components involved
   - Trace memory system interactions and dependencies
   - Focus on cross-platform compatibility across memory tiers
   - Verify information flow between components
   - Test for proper implementation of biological mechanisms

// CODING STANDARDS
1. Follow biologically-inspired patterns for component lifecycle management
2. Implement proper error handling with health-aware feedback mechanisms
3. Use consistent resource allocation for memory systems
4. Ensure proper handling of cognitive parameters and state
5. Document all critical cognitive processes and interactions
6. Prioritize performant solutions (measure memory and processing impact)

// COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES
1. Provide concise, direct explanations
2. Use code examples when relevant
3. Reference specific lines in codebase
4. Clearly mark completed vs pending cognitive processes
5. Propose practical next steps based on current system state

// PROJECT VISION
Remember this is a NeuroCognitive Architecture that enhances Large Language Models with 
biologically-inspired cognitive capabilities. The implementation should maximize 
human-like reasoning through a three-tiered memory system (Working, Episodic, Semantic), 
health dynamics, and proper neurological processes.
